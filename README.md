# Vahini Maps – Frontend Modules (Ongoing Project)

This repository contains all the core frontend modules I’ve developed as part of the **Vahini Maps** web application — a safety-first platform that helps women find secure travel routes, give feedback on areas, and verify safe businesses.

Each module below is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and designed to be easily integrated into the overall project.
